NAME
    Swagger2 - Swagger RESTful API Documentation

VERSION
    0.82

DESCRIPTION
    Swagger2 is a module for generating, parsing and transforming swagger
    <http://swagger.io/> API specification. It has support for reading
    swagger specification in JSON notation and as well YAML format.

    Please read
    <http://thorsen.pm/perl/programming/2015/07/05/mojolicious-swagger2.html
    > for an introduction to Swagger and reasons for why you would to use
    it.

  Mojolicious server side code generator
    This distribution comes with a Mojolicious plugin,
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Swagger2, which can set up routes and perform input
    and output validation.

  Mojolicious client side code generator
    Swagger2 also comes with a Swagger2::Client generator, which converts
    the client spec to perl code in memory.

RECOMMENDED MODULES
    *   YAML parser

        A YAML parser is required if you want to read/write spec written in
        the YAML format. Supported modules are YAML::XS, YAML::Syck, YAML
        and YAML::Tiny.

SYNOPSIS
      use Swagger2;
      my $swagger = Swagger2->new("/path/to/api-spec.yaml");

      # Access the raw specification values
      print $swagger->api_spec->get("/swagger");

      # Returns the specification as a POD document
      print $swagger->pod->to_string;

ATTRIBUTES
  api_spec
      $pointer = $self->api_spec;
      $self = $self->api_spec(Mojo::JSON::Pointer->new({}));

    Holds a Mojo::JSON::Pointer object containing your API specification.

  base_url
      $mojo_url = $self->base_url;

    Mojo::URL object that holds the location to the API endpoint. Note: This
    might also just be a dummy URL to <http://example.com/>.

  ua
      $ua = $self->ua;
      $self = $self->ua(Mojo::UserAgent->new);

    A Mojo::UserAgent used to fetch remote documentation.

  url
      $mojo_url = $self->url;

    Mojo::URL object that holds the location to the documentation file. This
    can be both a location on disk or an URL to a server. A remote resource
    will be fetched using Mojo::UserAgent.

METHODS
  expand
      $swagger = $self->expand;

    This method returns a new "Swagger2" object, where all the references
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03#section-5.28> are
    resolved.

  find_operations
      $operations = $self->find_operations(\%q);

    Used to find a list of Operation Objects
    <http://swagger.io/specification/#operationObject> from the
    specification. %q can be:

      $all        = $self->find_operations;
      $operations = $self->find_operations($operationId);
      $operations = $self->find_operations({operationId => "listPets"});
      $operations = $self->find_operations({method => "post", path => "/pets"});
      $operations = $self->find_operations({tag => "pets"});

  javascript_client
      $file = $self->javascript_client;

    Returns a Mojo::Asset::File object which points to a file containing a
    custom JavaScript file which can communicate with
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Swagger2.

    See
    <https://github.com/jhthorsen/swagger2/blob/master/lib/Swagger2/swagger2
    -client.js> for source code.

    "swagger2-client.js" is currently EXPERIMENTAL!

  load
      $self = $self->load;
      $self = $self->load($url);

    Used to load the content from $url or "url". This method will try to
    guess the content type (JSON or YAML) by looking at the content of the
    $url.

  new
      $self = Swagger2->new($url);
      $self = Swagger2->new(%attributes);
      $self = Swagger2->new(\%attributes);

    Object constructor.

  parse
      $self = $self->parse($text);

    Used to parse $text instead of loading data from "url".

    The type of input text can be either JSON or YAML. It will default to
    YAML, but parse the text as JSON if it starts with "{".

  pod
      $pod_object = $self->pod;

    Returns a Swagger2::POD object.

  to_string
      $json = $self->to_string;
      $json = $self->to_string("json");
      $yaml = $self->to_string("yaml");

    This method can transform this object into Swagger spec.

  validate
      @errors = $self->validate;

    Will validate "api_spec" against Swagger RESTful API Documentation
    Specification
    <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md
    >, and return a list with all the errors found. See also "validate" in
    JSON::Validator.
